Hi, I'm Nathanael Ian Gunadi ðŸ‘‹

About Me

Originally from Indonesia, I am a third-year Computer Science major at Aoyama Gakuin University, Tokyo. I have a deep passion for meeting new people, just as much as I enjoy discovering new ways to code and broadening my perspective through innovative thinking. I specialize in creating personalized solutions, building intuitive user interfaces, and collaborating across teams to achieve impactful results.
